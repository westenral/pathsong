We will be comparing the algorithms: dijkstra and prims
These algorithms will be compared given the task of traversing a graph.
The goal of these traversals is to highlight a path (edge) that connects two songs
chosen by the user. These connections will be based off of a similarity score which
will be determined using subsets like genre, key, tempo, and mode.
