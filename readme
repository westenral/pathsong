We will be comparing the algorithms: dijkstra and prims
These algorithms will be compared given the task of traversing a graph.
The goal of these traversals is to highlight a path (edge) that connects two songs
chosen by the user with the aim of creating a smooth transition between songs that can
be used for a variety of tasks, like making mashups and dj-ing. [These connections will
be based off of a similarity score from 0 - 255 (with 0 being max similarity)] which will
be determined using subsets like key, mode, genre, and energy.

The SongGraph class contains our adjacency matrix representation of a graph of songs
that will be narrowed down from the data set for convenience using the subsets.
